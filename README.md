Amazon Clone: A Full-Stack E-commerce Replica
Welcome to the repository for a feature-rich Amazon Clone, a comprehensive web application built to replicate the core functionality and user experience of a modern e-commerce platform. This project was developed as a personal portfolio piece to showcase my skills in front-end development, state management, and user authentication using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

This application provides a seamless and responsive shopping experience, allowing users to browse products, manage their carts, and interact with the platform just like on a real e-commerce site.

‚ú® Key Features
User-Facing Features
Authentication: Users can sign up and log in securely, with their data persisted in local storage.

Product Catalog: Browse a wide range of products with an intuitive, responsive grid layout.

Search Functionality: Easily find specific items using a robust search bar.

Shopping Cart: Add, view, and remove items from a dynamic shopping cart.

Product Details: Click on any product to view a detailed page with images, descriptions, and pricing.

Reviews & Comments: Users can submit reviews and comments on products, creating a more interactive community.

Admin Features
Admin Panel: A dedicated interface for the administrator (me) to manage the product catalog.

Item Management: Admins can easily add new products to the store or remove existing ones.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
HTML5: Provides the foundational structure for every page of the application.

CSS3: All styling, including the responsive layout, elegant product cards, and dynamic UI elements, is handled with CSS.

JavaScript (ES6+): Manages all the core logic, including user authentication, local storage management, shopping cart functionality, and dynamic content rendering.

Local Storage: Used as a lightweight database for persisting user data, cart items, and product information.
